                <h4>Description:</h4>
                <p> The name of this app is Best Friend, inspired by the infamous tv show ‘Friends’. The show revolves around daily activities of six best friends who live in Manhattan, New York. What I love about it is that the protagonists stick together through thick and thin, share their thoughts and always have each other’s back. Having this name, I hope the users can have the same experience with the app like how the main characters in Friends have with each other.</p>

                    <p><strong> Virtual friend:</strong> I would like to create an emulated human in this app which takes a pivotal role in the app by becoming a “listener”. The main task of this friend is to listen to the user’s thoughts to process, or “understand”, and from there give out a reasonable feedback. This is basically a communication between the user and the machine, but with less automatic responses. The friend will have a figure like a human being, with full facial and body parts. When user uses the app, the virtual friend will pop up on the screen and asking in a real, pre- recorded voice “Hi, how’s your day?” or something else, depends on the setup.</p>

                      <p><strong> Voice recordings: </strong> : I want to give users an authentic feeling as best as possible because it will prepare them for the future ahead. This app is not solely about relaxing or de-stressing, but it also works as a simulator so that it can prepare the users for real social situations. Another part when having voice is that it creates an intimate, soothing feeling and this point has been proved. ‘Talking leads to a catharsis, which means a feeling of relief. The charged feelings within us become less charged. Nothing has changed that caused the suffering in our lives, but talking has drained off some of the pain and this brings relief.’ (‘How talking helps’ 2011, para. 3). Therefore, having voice recording is essential for the app.</p>

                <p><strong>Informations about different disorders:</strong> This feature is called a library, where contains many informations about how to deal with mental issues, for example, nervous, breakdown or anxiety. The data will be gathered from credible sources like PsycheCentral, WebMD or NIMH (the National Institute of Mental Health) in order to make the right decision to tell users what they should do. The library is either given out by the virtual friend or stalled as a guide book in a different category for users to read. In the library will also contains some music pieces or songs that are calming and comforting.</p>

                <p style="text-align: right;">The virtual pet will need to be a part of a mobile application like My Talking Tom. There are two types of mobile applications, which are iOS and Android. For Android, we need to use Java, and Swift for iOS. These are two of the most widely used programming languages because of their multi- purpose and flexibility. The graphic of the pet needs to use the tools similar to interactive games, hence I choose Unity 3D. Unity 3D is mainly written in C# and it allows a various of operating systems to work on it. The AI model needs to be trained on Python, a high- level and easily readable programming language. Restful API is also needed when the hybrid is created and for this we use JavaScript.</p>
