                  <p style="color: white;"><strong>The state-of-the-art in natural language processing is GPT-3. According to CNBC, ‘GPT-3 (Generative Pre-training) is a language-generation tool capable of producing human-like text on demand.’ (Sam Shead 2020, p.2). It was created by OpenAI, an AI research laboratory based in San Francisco and was first introduced in May 2020. In comparison to its precedent, the Turing-NLG from Microsoft Research with 17 billion machine learning parameters, the GPT-3 has ten times more capacity than that with 175 billion. This software has the ability to produce human-like texts from observing original patterns. What is interesting about GPT-3 is that the quality of the product is so high, sometimes it is impossible to differentiate which one was written by human from ones written by machines. This tool is useful in many circumstances. For instance, it can answer questions based on a given text even though the questions use a lot of idioms and slangs. When a customer sends a request through a chatterbox to the company, GPT-3 will be used for the program to reply with a whole sentence as. Some game developers are also using this tool to enhance the text quality of the game, one outstanding example is AI Dungeon. </strong></p>
                  <p style="color: white;"><strong>Humans communicate in different languages like English, Chinese, German and many more, but for computers, there is only one and it is peculiar from all of which humans speak in. Therefore, in order to enable communication between machine and us, natural language processing is born. Surprisingly, with the development in technology, now they can reach out to any human-spoken languages, and even translate from one to another. With those benefits, this technology has been used in a versatile of majors. Marketers use it to monitor their social medias, like make a notice when a customer gives a feedback or write hashtags to attract business. Filtering spams is also one of its usages. Spams are a huge problem in this digital world whereas statistics have shown that they are responsible for 45% of our emails sent (Emily Bauer 2018). Ever since NLP is utilized, the prevention of receiving spams is higher, along with our life quality. Autocomplete, autocorrect and spell check are also parts of natural languages processing. Students and workers heavily rely on these tools in writing essays and reports. Without their help, our work could have been much stressful and long lasting. There are many spell check apps on the market nowadays like Grammarly, Ginger and PaperRater that applies NLP as well.</strong></p>
                  <p style="color: white;"><strong> is predicted that in the near future, NLP will continue to grow rapidly, creating more jobs for people who is interested in studying it. More fields will be dependent on this technology; healthcare is a prime example. This industry requires more handwritings, textual notes and clinical paper works more than any other ones. If NLP can be utilized here, healthcare workers can save a lot of time and energy. Our life quality can be upgraded with the computer being able to tell our moods. From a simple text, NLP will run diagnosis to find out whether we are sad, happy, depressed or stressed at the time. </strong></p>

                  <p style="color: white;"><strong> Natural languages processing has brought back many advantages as well as disadvantages. The most noticeable advantage is life quality improvement. With NLP, customer service has progressed to another level. Nowadays it is not solely about replying to feedbacks and questions, but to understand the thoughts and needs from buyers. This technology also contributes a big part into security. There have been many cases where victims of domestic abuses pretended to call 911 for a pizza order but actually were asking for helps. If the person on the other side of the line could not realize the hidden messages or the caller’s partner know about what they are doing, the consequences would be unimaginable. For these specific circumstances, NLP will be immensely useful. It can help distinguish the tones of the voice, and ring an alert if needed. This can help reduce the amount of abused victims all around the world who are too afraid to speak up. Beside from the positivities, there exist some negativities. Since it is difficult to figure out human written texts and machine produced texts, there is a high chance that fraud will rise up. Criminals can fake signatures to have an access to our bank accounts or impersonate our writing tones to send fake messages to our friends. Overall, these disadvantages can be prevented and I believe the advantages of NLP will make it an indispensable technology in the future. </strong></p>
                  <p style="color: white;"><strong> The impact of this technology will touch everyone in the world, regardless of the social status. With the bloom in data fields, more jobs will be created in the future, opening more chances for young people. As our language continues to evolve every day, it requires more people to study NLP in order to keep it updated. Because it can understand emotions from speaker through their tones, it can become a great partner for people experiencing social anxiety. ‘People with this disorder have trouble talking to people, meeting new people, and attending social gatherings.’ (‘Social Anxiety Disorder’ 2019, p.1). With an assistance which can understand their fear, they will slowly open up again, and hopefully, be healed from their disorder. </strong></p>

              <div class="container-fluid">
                  <p style="color: white;"><strong> As a student, I rely heavily on online translation website, which utilizes natural languages processing, to write essays and reports. When I read or hear a word I do not understand, I will use google translate to know the meaning of that word, and also to see its synonyms and antonyms. After finishing my work, I use grammar checking tool to go through it all over again. With someone who is clumsy like me, this tool has been much of a savor. I also use NLP to autocomplete my sentence. Being a teenager in a world with advanced technology, I get lazier each day because of the convenience that it brings back. Without questions, that is why autocomplete and autocorrect are very favorable for young people like me. With that being said, our parents also like to use these tools as well for it helps them to write faster and more correctly.</strong></p>
