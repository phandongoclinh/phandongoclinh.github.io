                <h4>Team name</h4>
                <p><strong>The Gunslingers:</strong> This name is inspired by the novel “The Gunslinger” by Stephen King. The protagonist in the book, or The Gunslinger, is inteligent, precise and decisive, all of the characters which I look for in a team.</p>                     
                <p>The Gunslinger do the job mostly and at best in isolation. However, in the original work, King also portrayed his protagonist to be an amazing teacher and friend with Jake. I also wish myself to be like him, which means I can shine in both individual and team work.</p>

              <h4>Team profile</h4>
              <h6>For Assignment 1: My Profile, I took three personality tests, which are the MBTI, the Learning Style test the Global EI. </h6>  
              <h6> Based on these results, I have come up with some ideas of what my ideal team would look like:</h6>
               <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p> My team should consist of four members, five at most. This is a perfect number as there are not too many or too few people, thus makes the connection in the team become easier. Moreover, with this number of people in a group, the task can be divided equally and suits best to each team member.</p>
                    <p>	I would like to have at least two <strong> out-going  </strong>members in my team. As seen in my MBTI test result, I am mostly introverted, hence tend to keep things for myself. With my personality, I can not create a friendly, strong-bonded environment. Therefore, having extroverts in the team would make the perfect balance because they will befriend everyone and bring us closer.</p>

                      <p><strong>Responsibility </strong> is the key in choosing team mates. They need to be able to carry their part in the work and show contribution. If a team member can not full fill their role, others will have to take on their parts. This can be a real damage to the team and potentially hamper the final work.</p>
                      <p><strong> Honesty </strong> is also highly rated in choosing team mates. If they can not finish their tasks due to a variable of reasons, the rest of the team deserves to know. If they can not make it to the meetings, we would like to be notified. Most importantly, if they have new ideas, I would like them to speak up. </p>

                      <p><strong> A positive attitude </strong> is much needed. Failure and hiatus are expected in any team project. There is no way that things will go smoothly from the beginning to the end. Therefore,
                        remaining optimistic during hardship will bring the team back to game as soon as possible, and make sure that we can catch up with the deadlines.

What I need is someone who is adaptive and flexible to lead the team into success.</p>
