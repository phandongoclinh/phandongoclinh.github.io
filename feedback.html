              <h6>I have collected three feedbacks from my classmates and here are their words: </h6>

                  <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p> “I think your idea is really interesting and might be helpful to many people. However, I am concerned about some people will be depend too much on the app and close their door with the real world. Will talking to the app reduce their depression or their interaction with other people? It can make them feel quite relax at first since they can release their depression to an online friend, however, that will make them less want to talk to others. This might not happen all the time but I think there is a high possibility of this.” – Minh Trang </p>
                    <br><br>

                      <p>“The project idea about creating an app called "Best Friend" is very interesting. It can be used for some mental treatment methods for depressed or unmotivated people by creating a 3D human character that can listen to user's story and give them some advice. In order to improve this project idea, the voice recording needs to be more specific (whose voice will the app will use? What voice tone that the developer will choose? etc….). But overall, the idea to create an 3D friend is very interesting.” – Nguyễn Huy</p>

                  <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>“I love Linh's idea of getting as authentic as possible virtual therapy. However, she can integrate a specific disorder and how that virtual friend can help their customers improve their current conditions in a specific way. For example, in an eating disorder, the friend will have the eating tracking of the frequencies and ingredients that their customers consume and give them personalized pieces of advice, recommended substitutions. Though her course objective can be inferred throughout the description's structure, it is better to state headings in bold.” – Anh Thư</p>

                    <p> Having third opinions for any project ideas is essential in helping it develop, and my classmates have given me some very helpful ones. They commented on different aspect in my project and had a deep dive into the problems. </p>

                    <p>Firstly, about Minh Trang’s feedback, she has a very interesting point in saying that this app can make people become reliant on it and consequently, they will stop having social contact. I agree with her feedback on this, because I actually mentioned about it in the project but without a proper evaluation. Indeed, I have underestimate the possibility of people taking this app as a consolation from there disabilities and problems, and then depend their life on it. This aspect plays a pivotal role in the morality of the project, therefore, must not be passed by. From Trang’s feedback, I will work harder and look deeper to find a solution for the problem. All in all, her comments were very in-depth and worthwhile to me.</p>

                    <p>Secondly, in terms of Huy’s opinions, I also find them to be very constructive and useful. He took a look into the voice recordings aspect and suggested me to write them with more specifics. Looking back at that part in “Project Ideas”, I agree with him. I did not write that function with all the details, and it could create a disadvantage to the whole project. From his feedback, I will look more closely into this function to make it more detailed and interesting. On the other, his compliment on the project works as an affirmation to erase my doubts and encourages me to strive further.</p>

                    <p>Last but not least, Anh Thư’s feedback. Thư has a strong personality and it shows in her comment. She reviews both about the content and the presentation in my report and they are all very valuable. She suggests that I should add more functions to the project so that it can be outstanding from somewhat similar to a google search. This opinion is pivotal in developing the idea of my project because without a doubt, I do not want it to turn into a Google Assistance second version. She also comments on the way I present my work and gives some examples about how to make it more visually pleasant. In brief, her feedback holds a significant position in the progress of my project. </p>
