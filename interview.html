                  <p style="color: rgb(8, 8, 8);">The main character is a Cyber Security Specialist who works for a company that holds contracts with the government. His day starts at 6.30 AM when he wakes up, does personal hygiene, and prepare for work. All of this would take about 2 hours, and after that, he leaves for work at 8.30 AM. When arriving, the first thing he does is attending a meeting that lasts half an hour. Later, he checks and replies to his emails, followed by inspecting logs on Spluck. After break time, at 2.30 PM, he goes to an offsite data center to do some redundancy testing. An hour later, he goes back to his office to see whether there are any vulnerabilities on some programming language, in this video, it is Python. He ends his work day with writing reports, and then he goes home.</p>
                  <p style="color:  rgb(8, 8, 8);">In this video, aside from his wife, it can be seen that he interacts with his bosses in the meetings, as well as his colleagues at workplace. So I assume that they are all IT professionals.</p>
                  <p style="color:  rgb(8, 8, 8);">Most of the time, he stays in his office to solve the workload. The video shows that 90% of his work revolves around sitting at the office to find errors, loopholes or bugs, and since he works on the Security fields so it is easily understandable. Besides from working in the office, there are some times when he can work without looking at the computer screen, which is when going to the offsite data center.</p>             
                  <p style="color: rgb(8, 8, 8);">Despite not mentioning about the most challenging aspect in the position, I can tell that he has to work with cautiousness all the time. When practicing in a big corporation, the risk of being attacked and destroyed is always marginal. Therefore, people work in his position have to work with twice the workload and stress. All in all, even though he does not outright state that his job is difficult, there are already enough reasons for the viewers to understand.</p>

                  <p style="color: rgb(8, 8, 8);">The main character in this video works as a Software Engineer at Senior position in Microsoft, one of the biggest tech company in the world. To start his day, he does some exercises like jumping ropes and lifting weights, following with making post-workout protein shakes and coffee. Since we’re in the middle of a pandemic, he works at home like any other employees and he starts off with a daily standup. In this standup, the common activities are: checking thought emails, updating tasks, reviewing meetings as well as daily goals, and updating status. Other than that, he does some code checking and reviewing using his computer at home or at the office. Later, back at his home, he does some more work left that day. </p>
                  <p style="color: rgb(8, 8, 8);">Because the context of the video is the pandemic, therefore he mostly appears by himself. However, he does some contact with his colleagues, presumably all IT professionals, at daily standups via video calls where we can see their faces. At one point, he does show that he drops by his office but unfortunately, no one is there.</p>
                  <p style="color: rgb(8, 8, 8);">Most of his works revolves around code reviews, as stated in the video, and also implements API codes. Rather than working all around the clock, he spends an amount of time in the day doing exercises and having fun with his friends. It could be said from the video that he has a very balanced life, despite working at a high position like Senior Engineer in a top- notch company like Microsoft. He is, in fact, a role model for a lot of youngsters nowadays on balancing between work and personal life.</p>

                  <p style="color: rgb(8, 8, 8);">Paolo, the YouTube channel’s owner, interviews Masa who is a Game Developer in Bandai Namco Studio in Tokyo, Japan. His day starts with him waking up and does personal hygiene in about 5- 10 minutes, and then he commutes to work in train. The whole process can take up to almost an hour. He completes his morning tasks firstly after arriving at work, and later off to lunch. During his break he can chill out with the game machine or go to sleeping booth. Later, he attends a scrum meeting to discuss about what they have done in the previous day, then continues with his coding until the end of the day. Every two weeks a Sprint Review is held where they would further discuss about the game details. To end his work, he checks through his emails to makes sure he does not miss anything and writes a log of today’s activities.</p>
                  <p style="color: rgb(8, 8, 8);"> There are a lot of people whom Masa meets in a day. There is his colleague who is also a Game Developer during lunch, his team who are IT professionals and his supervisor in the scrum meeting, and people who work in the finance department to ask about expenses for the game. On the other hand, Paolo gets to meet with Director and Development Producer of a game called Code Vein and a Director of game Tekken 7. Most of the time they spend are at their desk finishing daily tasks and writing some codes. For others, they will test out the character in a game’s function by playing the game.</p>
                  <p style="color: rgb(8, 8, 8);">The most challenging aspect in their job must be daily meeting. They have to meet up with people who are at higher position than them and speak up about their opinions. This task may appear to be simple to most people, but to someone who is quiet and reserved like Masa, he does not really enjoy doing that.</p>

                  <p style="color: rgb(8, 8, 8);">Mayuko is a Software Engineer who used to work for a company in Silicon Valley but is now a full- time creator. In the video above, she explained in details what she did at work back at the time. Her position at the company was Product Engineer and this position required a lot of team meetings and discussions. They all needed to provide their expertise but ended up making decisions all together and this process passed by very quickly since there were many people involved. After several discussions, the upcoming part was her and her colleagues as Product Engineer to do, which was to build stuffs Once having the plans, she would ask for feedbacks from her colleagues to make sure that her plan make sense. Next, she would go do some coding.</p>
                  <p style="color: rgb(8, 8, 8);">Mayuko had to interact with a lot of people from different positions at the company. In order to create a product, she had to work with the Product Manager, the Designers and other Product Engineers at the meetings and they all needed to share their opinions. The meetings were held frequently therefore the amount of times she interacted with her Manager was a lot. On the other hand, when she wanted a second opinions on her plans, she would consult with other engineers who worked in the same company.</p>
                  <p style="color: rgb(8, 8, 8);">Most of the time she would spend on building stuff. In order to do this, she would ask herself questions like “Do I need to coordinate with other teams?”, “Should I use what Apple has provided me or should I make a custom version of it?”, etc…. After finishing this part, she continued with coding the program, which sometimes went according to the plan and sometimes did not. Alongside with adding features, she also fixed some bugs or made improvements to the tests or toolings. On some day she would spent mostly on attending meetings and only a couple of hours to code, on some other days it was vice versa, hence her work was very flexible.</p>
                  <p style="color: rgb(8, 8, 8);">The challenging part about her position was maintaining balance. Technology changes every day, therefore the company needs to keep up with the trend or fall out of the rank, especially at companies in the Silicon Valley, where there are a lot of rivals trying to out-rank you. Being a part of such company, sometimes the workload was a little overwhelming to Mayuko and she was afraid that it could be too much. Perhaps that was one of the reason why she quit her job at the company and became a content creator. </p>

                  <p style="color: rgb(236, 236, 236);"> <strong>Alexandra is a Front End Developer. To start a day, she attends a daily standup where they talk about yesterday’s tasks, today’s goals and what to do if you are blocked. In order to produce a final product, she has to learn and practice a lot from others and vice versa. She makes demos around once a week only, but with the rest of her time, she also hears from other colleague. Having meetings with people from higher positions is important because that is the time when she can ask questions, give feedbacks or just to keep up with them in general. Of course, coding is indispensable as it is a big part of what she does in a day. Finally, she ends her day checking through emails and writing reports. </strong></p>
                  <p style="color: rgb(236, 236, 236);"><strong> In order to create the best- looking website, she cross- collaborates with the Product Manager and Designer, and this process is necessary because it helps everyone keeping track with others’ work and prevents overlaps. At the time in the video, she was working with disney.com and also starwars.com. She learns from other Engineers on their demos so as to develop her own. Twice a week, a one-to-one meeting is held between Alexandra and her team leader. During the meeting they will reflect on each other together with answering work- related questions. </strong></p>
                  <p style="color: rgb(236, 236, 236);"><strong>70% of her work is about coding and building things. There are many small parts in this process and it requires her to do all of the things mentioned above. In brief, it is mostly self- study and internal- study. Adding features to the website and fixing bugs are parts of her daily work routine as well. With the meetings being held online, it creates a flexibility in her routine. </strong></p>
